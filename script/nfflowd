=head1 NAME

Net::Netfilter::NetFlow - App to generate Cisco NetFlow from Linux netfilter

=head1 PURPOSE

If you run a Linux based firewall, the C<nfflowd> application in this
distribution will generate a stream of Cisco NetFlow logging data for all TCP,
UDP and ICMP connections passing through.

What makes this different from other solutions is that it uses Linux netfilter's
own connection tracking data, rather than observing a traffic capture. This is
more efficient for your CPU, and allows tracking of NAT which would otherwise
not be possible.

No reconfiguration of the firewall ruleset or network is required.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make sure you have the C<conntrack> and C<flow-tools> packages installed on
your Linux firewall system.

 write a small configuration describing your NetFlow collector:
 ~# cat > /etc/nfflowd.conf
 <flow_send>
     # source interface on this server
     args 10.0.0.1
     # netflow collector address
     args 192.168.0.1
     # netflow collector port number
     args 65001
 </flow_send>
 ^D
 
 to start the logger as a daemon:
 ~# nfflowd start
 
 to specify a custom configuration other than /etc/nfflowd.conf:
 ~# nfflowd -c /other/config/file.ini

=head1 LIMITATIONS

=over 4

=item *

It's assumed that Source IP NAT is taking place. If not, you may receive
additional unecessary log lines, sorry. Work is planned to change the
conntrack parser to be configurable for different local modes of operation.

=item *

Currently only TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic is logged. Again this will likely be
improved as part of the planned changes to the conntrack output parser.

=item *

The tool supports only IPv4 tracking. Is there a C<conntrack> for IPv6?

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The application C<nfflowd> included in this distribution is designed to run as
a daemon (background) process on a Linux based firewall running IPtables.

Its purpose is to capture data from the Linux netfilter subsystem about each
tracked data connection passing through the firewall, and log this in Cisco
NetFlow format to a remote NetFlow collector server. We recommend the Argus 3
software for that collector (L<http://www.qosient.com/argus/>). With the
default configuration you will also receive a local copy of the same data via
C<syslog>, under the C<local6> facility.

C<nfflowd> was written for NAT environments where you have a requirement to
trace the IP address on the "private" side which made a particular connection
or flow to a port/destination on the "public" (Internet) side. The NetFlow
streams logged will allow you to trace back to that private IP.

The daemon requires no reconfiguration of your firewall ruleset or network,
but you may need to install one or two additional helper programs. These are
commonly available in most Linux distributions - see L</DEPENDENCIES>, below.

C<nfflowd> is also efficient and accurate, as it uses Linux netfilter's own
connection logging and tracking data. This is preferable to observing a
promiscuous traffic capture, which may be CPU intensive and certainly cannot
track NAT connections.

=head2 What's special about NAT?

An issue that's specific to NAT (rather than general Netflow from a Linux
router) is that you really need a good and accurate record of the IP and port
number translation. So there are I<two> traffic flows, one before and one
after the NAT. Both need logging, together with a way to correlate them.

Traditionally such things are attempted using two instances of
C<softflowd> or C<argus>, one each side of the NAT. With accurate timestamping
the two flows (pre and post-NAT) can be correlated and then the IP and port
translation deduced.

However this doesn't work for very long running flows, or where there are
numerous flows to a destination, some of which are legitimate and some not.
There exist cases where it is impossible to be sure that you are correlating
the correct two flow records. Seeing as netfilter is already accurately
tracking every connection, with NAT information, we can make use of that data.

=head1 USAGE

The C<nfflowd> application included in this distribution is designed to run as
a daemon (background) process. It also supports running in the foreground. You
will need to provide a small amount of configuration, and otherwise there are
sane defaults for all options.

Here is the help text for the current version of C<nfflowd>:

 Usage: nfflowd [ -c file ] [ -f ] { start | stop | restart | install | check | help | version } 
  -c file     Specify configuration file (instead of /etc/nfflowd.conf)
  -f          Run in the foreground (don't detach)
  start       Starts a new nfflowd if there isn't one running already
  stop        Stops a running nfflowd
  restart     Stops a running nfflowd if one is running.  Starts a new one.
  install     Setup nfflowd to run automatically after reboot
  check       Check the configuration file and report the daemon state
  help        Display this usage info
  version     Display the version of nfflowd

Although the C<reload> option is also available, it currently has no effect.
Please note that the C<install> option has not been tested by the author.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

At minimum you need to provide a small configuration to let C<nfflowd> know
where your NetFlow collector server is. This by default can be located at
C</etc/nfflowd.conf> although you can specify an alternate location using the
C<-c> command line option. The format of the file can be anything supported by
L<Config::Any> (i.e. YAML, JSON, etc), although we recommend using
L<Config::General> format, as in the examples below.

The required configuration is the source IP on your firewall from which
NetFlow packets are sent, and the IP/port numbers of the NetFlow collector
server:

 <flow_send>
     # source interface on this server
     args 10.0.0.1
     # netflow collector address
     args 192.168.0.1
     # netflow collector port number
     args 65001
 </flow_send>

These three options must appear I<in the exact order given above>.

The other thing you might want to configure is whether and how a local copy of
the NetFlow data is stored on the Linux firewall itself, via Syslog. The
application uses L<Log::Dispatch> and by default will log to Syslog facility
C<local6> with priority <info>.

Below is the default configuration, which you can override in your local
C<nfflowd> configuration file, but B<be warned!> You I<must> retain the
C<screen> dispatcher and configuration section, otherwise the application will
stop working. You have the option to remove, change, or add to the C<syslog>
dispatcher only:

 <ptee>
     <conf>
         dispatchers screen
         dispatchers syslog
         <screen>
             stderr    0
             class     Log::Dispatch::Screen
             min_level debug
         </screen>
         <syslog>
             class     Log::Dispatch::Syslog
             ident     conntrack
             min_level debug
             facility  local6
         </syslog>
     </conf>
 </ptee>

In addition you can control how each of the helper applications are loaded and
configured. You would generally not need to do this, but here are the config
options anyway:

 <conntrack>
     progname    conntrack
     init_format -L
     format      -E -e NEW,DESTROY -o timestamp -n
 </conntrack>
 <flow_import>
     progname flow-import
     format   -z0 -f2 -V5 -m0xFF31EF
 </flow_import>
 <flow_send>
     progname flow-send
     format   -V5 -s %s/%s/%s
 </flow_send>

=head1 PAR Support

Simple tests have shown it should be possible to package up this application
with PAR, and ship to servers which do not have Perl and/or the Perl module
dependencies installed.
